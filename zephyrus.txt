how to deal with scripts and no bash,
  https://discourse.nixos.org/t/add-bin-bash-to-avoid-unnecessary-pain/5673/2

  /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash
  me@zephyrus:~/devel$ /usr/bin/env bash

  NO. for local scripts - in a shell  - just bring bash into sceop as well.
  bash *is* available. just not

  Just use the /usr/bin/env trampoline.
  eg.
  /usb/bin/env bash

  Nixos Running scripts problem
  https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/k8ja54/nixos_running_scripts_problem/

  Instead, the best way to run bash scripts, in any system, is to use
  #!/usr/bin/env bash as shebang.

  env bash simply is a way to search the PATH variable for the bash
  interpreter; you can use it env to find any interpreter on your PATH when the
  absolute location isn’t apparent. this is a common situation with
  interpreters such as with Python

  # env is the only command in /usb/bin or /bin
  $ ls /usr/bin/
  env

WORKING
  trackpad, keyboard, sound. display . super quick.

FAN

  should try disabling, gpu in bios.

  # enabling cpus on / off

    0
    root@zephyrus:~/nixos-config$ echo 0 >  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/online

  can see that it works in top.


  root@zephyrus:~/nixos-config$ nix-shell -p linuxPackages.cpupower

  [nix-shell:~/nixos-config]# cpupower frequency-info

  [nix-shell:~/nixos-config]# cpupower frequency-set -g powersave

  cpupower doc, very good and powerful
    https://documentation.suse.com/sled/15-SP1/html/SLED-all/cha-tuning-power.html

  cpupower frequency-set -u 1.2GHz

  this works eg. 
  # cat /proc/cpuinfo  | grep MH
  cpu MHz         : 1200.000
  cpu MHz         : 1200.000

  default is 2.
  0  turns off fans....  think only bbecause run after fans run at full. but maybe less.  *think its less*
  2  turns on again. 

  0 definitely seems less.

  Instead of manually controlling fan speed using asus-nb-wmi, it is also
  possible to set the thermal throttling policy to have a more or less aggressive
  fan control policy. Possible values are 0 (default), 1 (overboost) and 2
  (silent). 

  # temp of amdgpu graphics, and other stuff. eg. 54000 = 54 degC.
  cat /sys/class/drm/card0/device/hwmon/hwmon6/temp1_inpu

  In Kernel 5.6 there is a fan mode for asus laptops, check if you have
  /sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/throttle_thermal_policy
    2 - Silent,
    0 - Balance,
    1 - Turbo, similar to the modes in armoury crate on windows.

    $ cat /sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/throttle_thermal_policy

    0 seems slightly better.




  That being said, I run PRIME offloading with my current setup. I have an bash
  function called nvidia-run, that will offload the graphics rendering to the
  Nvidia card for any gaming or rendering workloads I have. I also pass it
  through enough into my Windows VM,

  turned off all cores except two. and then limited cpufreq to lowest possible. confirm in top. no change in fan behavior. 

  nvida drivers don't build against latest kernel. that's ok. the amd ok.

  much less fan noise compared to dell, when running freerouting, even though much faster. better fan, and better thermals.



nixos
  If nix configurations can be likened to distros, then I have the power to build an entire distribution from a single short command.
  nixos = build your own distro.
  nixos = meta distro.

  amazing, zero cost installs. without root. just create shell. played with glxgears first time in 20 years. in 20 seconds.

  everything in software is/has dependencies.
    - firefox has extensions/add ons,
    - vim has plugins,
    - java has library dependencies, multiple incompatible management systems - maven, ant, gradle ,
    - haskell, node, etc do too, all have transitive dependencies.
    - kernel has drivers. proprietary / open/ free.
    - git code has git/ git code submodules.

    they're all managed with separate/independent systems.
    dependency management is still the unsolved problem. nixos

    containers/docker/flatpack. yet another approach.

  nixos. "It's like Gentoo, but for adults".


nixos = second order linux system. meta linux.  can be shaped into anything, with a single command and declaration.

use cases
  - nothing should be able to read users mozilla session keys.c or ssh keys. or other private files.  except exempted processes, ssh, firefox.
  - nothing should be able to call out. eg. typical trojan code. except ssh, git, firefox. etc.

  Only option is trusted (ssh, firefox) and untrusted. software development. should be users.
  and try to change permissions.

search trojan. intrusion detection.
  It's trivial to put a watch on ~/.ssh/id_rsa with auditd to detect trojan. but so hard to prevent access - with selinux or apparmor.

=========================
SELinux and AppArmor exist for prevention of trojan / rootkit and other
infections. I tell the case for SELinux, which I know better. With SELinux
enabled, you give a context to all the process (daemon included) you install on
the machine. You also label the file system to work with the context, matching
them. When a process tries to do something not within its context, you receive
a message, and, if SELinux is in enforcing mode, the action cannot complete.
This way, if your ircd trojan was willing to overwrite the ps command or
something else (common strategy for trojans / rootkits / worms to avoid
detection), i would not be allowed to do that. And you would be informed.  I
knkow it's difficult to configure, but my machines are working with SELinux
enforced right now, and my (two) Fedora laptops can do anything a desktop needs
without too much hassle.  Even my home server is now in enforcing mode.
Another strategy is a regular run of rootkit detectors which calculate a
checksum for the cirtical commands, and inform you regarding changes in the
basic commands.  I work with both the SELinux and the rkhunter enabled (plus a
clamav antivirus).

Regards
=========================



what we want is all access allowed. but blacklist some items.
  but i dont think thats possible in apparmor for most processes which are unconfined.

apparmor issues.
  everythign runs unconfined.  it's not whether it's blacklist or whitelist first. its that there is no poliy.
  and everything is process based.
  path based mac.

selinux.

  Guy wants to limit internet to firefox - calling out.
    https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/5b25yv/between_apparmor_and_selinux_which_one_is_easier/




  very good article - on need for whitelist. for both
  https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/239436/linux-whitelist-based-mandatory-access-control-instead-of-a-blacklist-based-mode
    actually think it may be incorrect.

  "SELinux behaves the way you expect (white list). All access is denied by
  default. The other three points you expect also apply to SELinux."

  "SELinux uses a whitelist approach, meaning all access must be explicitly
  allowed in policy in order to be granted. "

  "SELinux is based upon the M4 computer language and therefore supports a
  variety of macros to save time."

  "SELinux is basically a whitelist for your entire system. AFAIK every file,
  directory or process gets an additional SELinux label which act like control
  lists."

  apparmor is unconfined by default, but it seems you can lock everything down:
  http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/FullSystemPolicy and then start whitelisting


  cannot search on 'whitelist'
  so the thing is how to whitelist everything - except a couple of dirs/files.

      and another approach,
      https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/01/17/how-to-write-a-rootkit-without-really-trying/

      OK.  So just need this kernel overide.
      Of course, this only works if your Linux kernel was compiled with CONFIG_KALLSYMS=1.

      GREAT!!.

      Of course, this only works if your Linux kernel was compiled with
      CONFIG_KALLSYMS=1. Debian and Ubuntu provide this, but you may need to test in
      other distros.

       cat /proc/kallsyms       <- whoot.

      used in here, https://github.com/trailofbits/krf
        Because it intercepts raw syscalls and not their libc wrappers, it can inject faults into calls made by syscall(3) or inline assembly.

        It probably only works on x86(_64), since it twiddles cr0 manually.
